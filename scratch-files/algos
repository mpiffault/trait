    - filter nearest lines into a set
    - calculate each intersections in the set
    - order by distance to the mouse pointer

# Find nearest line to trace parallels
Timed search : each second or so if the mouse is moving

    - filter nearest lines into an ordered list by distance to mouse pointer

# Find and represent side where parallel has to be draw
